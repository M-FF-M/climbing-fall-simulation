# Climbing Fall Simulation

This repository contains a webpage which can be used to simulate a climbing fall. Forces and rope stretching are simulated as accurately as possible and the simulation result is displayed using an animation as well as force, energy and position graphs.

The webpage is still work in progress. You can check out the current version at [https://m-ff-m.github.io/climbing-fall-simulation/](https://m-ff-m.github.io/climbing-fall-simulation/).

## To-Do List

- add playback control: animation speed
- add a mask for the simulation set-up
- add menu for choosing which pane displays what and additional settings
- add legends for the different types of force and energy graphs per object
- add a view showing the simulation when looking along the x-axis
- decrease the axis legend text size if it covers too much of the available space
- test zooming and panning on touch devices
- add the option to store simulation results in-browser and to download and upload them
- add proper quickdraws where the carabiner is attached to a fixed point via a sling
- properly implement damping for the rope to get rid of the too-springy behavior
